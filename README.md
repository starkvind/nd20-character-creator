# Naufragio d20 Character Creator
Webapp based on flask to create simple characters of Nd20 roleplaying game.

## How to install

First, install all the dependencies:
	- Create virtual environment
	- Install requirements from requirements.txt
	- Launch webapp by typing "python app.py" from terminal

## How to use

This app presents 2 options:
	- Initial Level: Put a number from 1 to 30. The script calculates all the Attribute upgrades from levelin' up.
	- Core Game: Actually, we have two different game based on the same engine:
		- Naufragio d20: Epic / dark fantasy like D&D, Pathfinder or whatever OSR retroclone you like.
		- Naufragio d20 — Ciencia Ficción: Space opera like Star Trek, Star Wars, Stars Without Number, Starfinder (wow, that's a lot of stars) or whatever scifi, humanoid alien fiction you like.

Select your Level and the Core Game, and the app will generate a character ready to play with.

## Future versions

I have written this in order to learn Python and how to use a webapp. Of course is all amateur code, but in the future i'll like add the different kinds of Powers that we have
on Naufragio d20 (Techs, Spells, Music, Psionic, etc.) and a flexible way of customizing more the results. Right not is kind of static, but it works for me.
